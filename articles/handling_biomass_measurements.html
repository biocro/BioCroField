<h2 id="overview">Overview<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#overview"></a>
</h2>
<p>The <code>BioCroField</code> package includes several features
related to measuring and processing raw data from biomass harvests, with
the ultimate goal of producing values that are useful in the context of
crop growth modeling. In particular, the package includes the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A crop harvest record sheet that can be used in the field to
record relevant data.</p></li>
<li><p>A document describing a general protocol for weighing dry
tissue.</p></li>
<li><p>Several crop-specific guides to harvesting and weighing
tissue.</p></li>
<li><p>An R function that accepts all the information from a crop
harvest record sheet and stores it in a convenient data
structure.</p></li>
<li><p>Additional R functions that calculate key variables from the raw
measurements and reorganize the results into a convenient
format.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Together, these features provide a straightforward system for
obtaining data and for creating a full record of its analysis. After
collecting and measuring the plant material, a complete description of
the data can be created as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Store images of the completed crop harvest record sheets in a
directory.</p></li>
<li><p>Store the commands used to digitize and process the data (such as
the ones in the <a href="#a-full-example">A Full Example</a> section of
this document) as an R script in the same directory.</p></li>
<li><p>Save the final biomass data table as a plain-text file in the
same directory using <code>write.csv</code>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Now the final biomass values will be available in a simple CSV
format, and the exact steps taken to analyze the data will be clear to
anyone who looks at this directory in the future, including yourself!
Even though some details might not be immediately apparent from the
script, the documentation for the functions from
<code>BioCroField</code> will describe how the calculations were
made.</p>
<p>The rest of this document explains the types of biomass measurements
that are important in the context of crop growth modeling (in the <a href="#biomass-and-leaf-area">Biomass and Leaf Area</a> section), the
general steps required to collect tissue in the field (in the <a href="#harvesting-material">Harvesting Material</a> section), the
general steps required to weigh the tissue (in the <a href="#weighing-tissue">Weighing Tissue</a> section), and how
<code>BioCroField</code> can be used to process the resulting data (in
the <a href="#processing-data-with-biocrofield">Processing Data with
BioCroField</a> section). The final section (<a href="#a-full-example">A
Full Example</a>) shows a realistic example of how the functions from
<code>BioCroField</code> can be used to process a full biomass data set
from a field season.</p>
<p>Throughout the document, we will provide several examples of R
commands. These examples will use functions from the
<code>BioCroField</code> and <code>lattice</code> R packages, which must
be loaded first using commands such as the following:</p>

<h2 id="biomass-and-leaf-area">Biomass and Leaf Area<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#biomass-and-leaf-area"></a>
</h2>
<p>When farmers and crop scientists want to compare the productivity of
different fields or varieties, they use a quantity called
<em>yield</em>, which can be defined as the amount of harvested material
per unit area. This is a loose and flexible definition; the type of
harvested material depends on the particular crop in question; the
amount can be specified as a volume, weight, or mass; and there are
several systems of units customarily used in different locations around
the world. Nevertheless, yield has proven to be a useful concept, at
least partially because it is an <em>intrinsic</em> property that does
not depend on the size of the field in which the crops were grown.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the harvested material <em>per
plant</em> is far less useful. As crops are grown at higher densities,
competition between the plants increases, and each plant tends to
produce less output. Thus, the harvest per plant depends not only on the
crop’s inhererent productivity but also the degree of competition
between plants. On the other hand, there is often a fairly wide range of
plant <em>population</em> (the number of plants per unit area) that can
result in identical or similar yield; for example, maize in Illinois
sown between April 5 and May 5 can reach 97% or higher of the maximum
yield for populations between 24,000 and 36,000 plants per acre <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nafziger_corn_1994">Nafziger
1994</a>)</span>. Thus, in most circumstances, the yield (on a per area
basis) better reflects the true productivity of a crop without the
complicating influence of competition.</p>
<p>In the context of crop growth modeling, we are typically interested
in predicting the yield (as a mass per unit area) of a particular crop
variety in a particular location. To do this, however, it is generally
necessary to predict the amount of other plant components (as masses per
unit area), such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Leaf</em>: The amount of leaf mass determines the amount of
carbon the crop is able to assimilate through the process of
photosynthesis, so leaf mass is critical for calculating growth
rates.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Root</em>: The amount of root mass determines the amount of
water and nitrogen the crop is able to obtain from the soil.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Litter</em>: As a crop ages, it begins to lose tissue through
the process of senescence. Some of the lost mass is recycled to other
parts of the plant, and the remainder is shed, forming the litter. The
competing processes of growth and senescence determine the masses of
components like the leaf and root.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Total</em>: Besides the components mentioned above, the crop
also uses carbon to grow its stem and other reproductive material like
flowers and pods. For accurate predictions, it is essential to
accurately model the distribution of carbon throughout all the crop
components.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, to validate a crop model, it is important to have
experimental measurements for all these crop components, ideally at
multiple times throughout a growing season. In addition to these masses,
it is critical to measure the <em>leaf area index</em> (LAI), defined as
the leaf area per unit ground area, which also plays a key role in
simulating photosynthesis at the canopy level <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-breda_groundbased_2003">Bréda 2003</a>)</span>. If the model
is able to reproduce these mass and leaf area measurements, we can have
more faith that it will be able to make accurate yield predictions in
other situations.</p>

<h2 id="harvesting-material">Harvesting Material<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#harvesting-material"></a>
</h2>
<p>To make measurements of these important quantities, it is necessary
to sow multiple plots and harvest plants from a single randomly-chosen
plot several times throughout a growing season, ending at the final
harvest. Each plot should also contain a wire mesh litter trap of known
area, and each harvest will generally include the following steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Choose a section of a row with a known length; count the plants
contained in the row section; cut each stem just above the ground; and
collect all the above-ground portions of each plant in a bag to be dried
and weighed. This can provide estimates for the population, the
above-ground biomass (AGB) per unit area, and the AGB per plant. For
this measurement, a length of row containing approximately 1-4 dozen
plants (depending on their size and spacing) should be used.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose a smaller number of sequential plants (often half a
dozen); cut each stem just above the ground; dig up and clean the roots
of these plants; split the above-ground portions of the plants into
components such as the stem, the living leaves, any senesced leaves
still attached to the plant, and any reproductive parts like flowers or
pods; and collect each separate component into a bag to be dried and
weighed. Combined with the AGB measurements above, this process can
provide estimates for the mass per area of each partitioned component.
It also provides a second estimate of the AGB per plant that can be
compared to the one determined in the previous step to determine whether
the plants chosen for paritioning were representative of the plot as a
whole.</p></li>
<li><p>Measure the total area of the living leaves that were partitioned
in the previous step. This process can provide an estimate for the
<em>specific leaf area</em> (SLA), defined as the leaf area per leaf
mass. Then the SLA and the leaf mass per unit area determined in the
previous step can be used to estimate the LAI.</p></li>
<li><p>Collect any litter that has fallen into the litter trap and put
it in a bag to be dried and weighed. Combined with any senesced material
still attached to the plant, this can provide an estimate for the litter
formed through the process of senescence.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Note the importance of drying the collected tissue before weighing.
The wet weight can vary greatly throughout the day and does not give an
accurate reflection of the amount of material that has been truly
incorporated into the structure of a crop. For instance, two meters of
freshly cut sorghum plants often weighs more than two meters of freshly
cut maize plants, but the maize is often heavier after drying because
sorghum retains more water in its stems.</p>

<h3 id="crop-harvest-record-sheets">Crop Harvest Record Sheets<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#crop-harvest-record-sheets"></a>
</h3>
<p>The <code>BioCroField</code> R package includes a carefully designed
crop harvest record sheet that includes clearly-labeled blank areas for
recording all of the harvest information described above. Each sheet
represents the harvest of one plot at one time. Using these sheets in
the field will help you stay organized, and will make sure your data is
organized in a way that will facilitate later analysis. The record sheet
can be accessed from R using the <code>access_sheet</code> function from
<code>BioCroField</code> as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<p>The sheet is also available via the <code>BioCroField</code> <a href="https://github.com/biocro/BioCroField/tree/main/inst/sheets/" class="external-link">GitHub
website</a>.</p>
<p>When using this sheet, it is recommended to electronically fill out
any fields whose values are known beforehand (such as location, year,
row spacing, name, and contact) and then print out the necessary number
of paper copies you will need throughout a field season.</p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="weighing-tissue">Weighing Tissue<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#weighing-tissue"></a>
</h2>
<p>Once the harvested tissue has been dried, it must be weighed. This is
a fairly straightforward process, but care must be taken to ensure that
the weights are reliable, and that all necessary tissue types have been
weighed. The <code>BioCroField</code> R package includes a document
describing a general protocol for doing this. It can be accessed from R
using the <code>access_sheet</code> function from
<code>BioCroField</code> as follows:</p>

<p>The details of weighing are somewhat different for each particular
crop. The sheets discussed in the <a href="#crop-specific-guide-sheets">Crop-Specific Guide Sheets</a>
section include advice and instructions for weighing tissue from several
key crops.</p>
<p>When using these sheets, it is recommended to print out one copy of
the weighing protocol and one copy of each relevant crop guide so you
can keep them on hand for reference while weighing.</p>

record sheets. The names of the input arguments to this function
generally match the fields present on the crop harvest record sheets,

<p>Once the data from one or more harvest record sheets has been stored
as an equal number of <code>harvest_point</code> objects, it is possible
to convert the raw weights, lengths, and areas into more convenient
values like biomass per unit area and leaf area index. This can be done
automatically using the <code>process</code> function from
<code>BioCroField</code>, which processes a single
<code>harvest_point</code> object to convert its information into a more
useful form. The following command illustrates how to process the
<code>harvest_point</code> defined above and view the processed
values:</p>

<p>The output from <code>process</code> is a <code>harvest_point</code>
object that has additional named elements that represent the newly
calculated values. More information is available via the built-in help
system by typing <code><a href="../reference/process.html">?process</a></code> in the R terminal.</p>
<p>Once the data from one or more harvest record sheets has been

is often a convenient way to store and use the data. This can be done
using the <code>biomass_table</code> function from

<code>harvest_point</code> objects, extracts the most important
information from each one, and stores the information in one row of a

<p>It is often useful to include information about the seeds that were
originally sown, such as the sowing date and the initial biomass per
unit area in the field, even though this is not truly “harvest”
information. These details can be included in a biomass data table (as
created by <code>biomass_table</code>) using the
<code>add_seed_biomass</code> function from <code>BioCroField</code>.
This operation is included in the <a href="#a-full-example">Full

three separate harvests are combined into a table along with information

GM4000 is not a real soybean variety, although the values here are
reasonable for a typical commercial soybean cultivar.</p>
