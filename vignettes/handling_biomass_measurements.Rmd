# Overview

The `BioCroField` package includes several features related to measuring and
processing raw data from biomass harvests, with the ultimate goal of producing
values that are useful in the context of crop growth modeling. In particular,
the package includes the following:

- A crop harvest record sheet that can be used in the field to record relevant
  data.

- A document describing a general protocol for weighing dry tissue.

- Several crop-specific guides to harvesting and weighing tissue.

- An R function that accepts all the information from a crop harvest record
  sheet and stores it in a convenient data structure.

- Additional R functions that calculate key variables from the raw measurements
  and reorganize the results into a convenient format.

Together, these features provide a straightforward system for obtaining data and
for creating a full record of its analysis. After collecting and measuring the
plant material, a complete description of the data can be created as follows:

1. Store images of the completed crop harvest record sheets in a directory.

2. Store the commands used to digitize and process the data (such as the ones
   in the [A Full Example] section of this document) as an R script in the same
   directory.

3. Save the final biomass data table as a plain-text file in the same directory
   using `write.csv`.

Now the final biomass values will be available in a simple CSV format, and the
exact steps taken to analyze the data will be clear to anyone who looks at this
directory in the future, including yourself! Even though some details might not
be immediately apparent from the script, the documentation for the functions
from `BioCroField` will describe how the calculations were made.

The rest of this document explains the types of biomass measurements that are
important in the context of crop growth modeling (in the [Biomass and Leaf Area]
section), the general steps required to collect tissue in the field (in the
[Harvesting Material] section), the general steps required to weigh the tissue
(in the [Weighing Tissue] section), and how `BioCroField` can be used to process
the resulting data (in the [Processing Data with BioCroField] section). The
final section ([A Full Example]) shows a realistic example of how the functions
from `BioCroField` can be used to process a full biomass data set from a field
season.

Throughout the document, we will provide several examples of R commands. These
examples will use functions from the `BioCroField` and `lattice` R packages,
which must be loaded first using commands such as the following:

```{r setup}
# Load required packages
library(BioCroField)
library(lattice)
```

If the `lattice` package is not installed on your R setup, you can install it by
typing `install.packages('lattice')`.

# Biomass and Leaf Area

When farmers and crop scientists want to compare the productivity of different
fields or varieties, they use a quantity called _yield_, which can be defined as
the amount of harvested material per unit area. This is a loose and flexible
definition; the type of harvested material depends on the particular crop in
question; the amount can be specified as a volume, weight, or mass; and there
are several systems of units customarily used in different locations around the
world. Nevertheless, yield has proven to be a useful concept, at least partially
because it is an _intrinsic_ property that does not depend on the size of the
field in which the crops were grown.

It is interesting to note that the harvested material _per plant_ is far less
useful. As crops are grown at higher densities, competition between the plants
increases, and each plant tends to produce less output. Thus, the harvest per
plant depends not only on the crop's inhererent productivity but also the degree
of competition between plants. On the other hand, there is often a fairly wide
range of plant _population_ (the number of plants per unit area) that can result
in identical or similar yield; for example, maize in Illinois sown between April
5 and May 5 can reach 97% or higher of the maximum yield for populations between
24,000 and 36,000 plants per acre [@nafziger_corn_1994]. Thus, in most
circumstances, the yield (on a per area basis) better reflects the true
productivity of a crop without the complicating influence of competition.

In the context of crop growth modeling, we are typically interested in
predicting the yield (as a mass per unit area) of a particular crop variety in a
particular location. To do this, however, it is generally necessary to predict
the amount of other plant components (as masses per unit area), such as the
following:

- _Leaf_: The amount of leaf mass determines the amount of carbon the crop is
  able to assimilate through the process of photosynthesis, so leaf mass is
  critical for calculating growth rates.

- _Root_: The amount of root mass determines the amount of water and nitrogen
  the crop is able to obtain from the soil.

- _Litter_: As a crop ages, it begins to lose tissue through the process of
  senescence. Some of the lost mass is recycled to other parts of the plant, and
  the remainder is shed, forming the litter. The competing processes of growth
  and senescence determine the masses of components like the leaf and root.

- _Total_: Besides the components mentioned above, the crop also uses carbon to
  grow its stem and other reproductive material like flowers and pods. For
  accurate predictions, it is essential to accurately model the distribution of
  carbon throughout all the crop components.

Therefore, to validate a crop model, it is important to have experimental
measurements for all these crop components, ideally at multiple times throughout
a growing season. In addition to these masses, it is critical to measure the
_leaf area index_ (LAI), defined as the leaf area per unit ground area, which
also plays a key role in simulating photosynthesis at the canopy level
[@breda_groundbased_2003]. If the model is able to reproduce these mass and leaf
area measurements, we can have more faith that it will be able to make accurate
yield predictions in other situations.

# Harvesting Material

To make measurements of these important quantities, it is necessary to sow
multiple plots and harvest plants from a single randomly-chosen plot several
times throughout a growing season, ending at the final harvest. Each plot should
also contain a wire mesh litter trap of known area, and each harvest will
generally include the following steps:

1. Choose a section of a row with a known length; count the plants contained in
   the row section; cut each stem just above the ground; and collect all the
   above-ground portions of each plant in a bag to be dried and weighed. This
   can provide estimates for the population, the above-ground biomass (AGB) per
   unit area, and the AGB per plant. For this measurement, a length of row
   containing approximately 1-4 dozen plants (depending on their size and
   spacing) should be used.

2. Choose a smaller number of sequential plants (often half a dozen); cut each
   stem just above the ground; dig up and clean the roots of these plants; split
   the above-ground portions of the plants into components such as the stem,
   the living leaves, any senesced leaves still attached to the plant, and any
   reproductive parts like flowers or pods; and collect each separate component
   into a bag to be dried and weighed. Combined with the AGB measurements above,
   this process can provide estimates for the mass per area of each partitioned
   component. It also provides a second estimate of the AGB per plant that can
   be compared to the one determined in the previous step to determine whether
   the plants chosen for paritioning were representative of the plot as a whole.

3. Measure the total area of the living leaves that were partitioned in the
   previous step. This process can provide an estimate for the
   _specific leaf area_ (SLA), defined as the leaf area per leaf mass. Then the
   SLA and the leaf mass per unit area determined in the previous step can be
   used to estimate the LAI.

4. Collect any litter that has fallen into the litter trap and put it in a bag
   to be dried and weighed. Combined with any senesced material still attached
   to the plant, this can provide an estimate for the litter formed through the
   process of senescence.

Note the importance of drying the collected tissue before weighing. The wet
weight can vary greatly throughout the day and does not give an accurate
reflection of the amount of material that has been truly incorporated into the
structure of a crop. For instance, two meters of freshly cut sorghum plants
often weighs more than two meters of freshly cut maize plants, but the maize is
often heavier after drying because sorghum retains more water in its stems.

## Crop Harvest Record Sheets

The `BioCroField` R package includes a carefully designed crop harvest record
sheet that includes clearly-labeled blank areas for recording all of the harvest
information described above. Each sheet represents the harvest of one plot at
one time. Using these sheets in the field will help you stay organized, and will
make sure your data is organized in a way that will facilitate later analysis.
The record sheet can be accessed from R using the `access_sheet` function from
`BioCroField` as follows:

```{r access_record_sheet, eval = FALSE}
access_sheet('harvest')
```

The sheet is also available via the `BioCroField`
[GitHub website](https://github.com/biocro/BioCroField/blob/main/inst/sheets/).

When using this sheet, it is recommended to electronically fill out any fields
whose values are known beforehand (such as location, year, row spacing, name,
and contact) and then print out the necessary number of paper copies you will
need throughout a field season.

## Crop-Specific Guide Sheets

The details of harvesting are somewhat different for each particular crop. The
`BioCroField` R package includes crop-specific guide sheets for several key
crops with advice about harvesting them. These guides can be accessed from R
using the `access_sheet` function from `BioCroField` as follows:

```{r access_guide_sheet, eval = FALSE}
access_sheet('cowpea_guide')
access_sheet('grain_sorghum_guide')
access_sheet('maize_guide')
access_sheet('soybean_guide')
```

They are also available via the `BioCroField`
[GitHub website](https://github.com/biocro/BioCroField/blob/main/inst/sheets/).

When using these sheets, it is recommended to print out one copy of each
relevant crop guide so you can keep it on hand for reference while harvesting.

# Weighing Tissue

Once the harvested tissue has been dried, it must be weighed. This is a fairly
straightforward process, but care must be taken to ensure that the weights are
reliable, and that all necessary tissue types have been weighed. The
`BioCroField` R package includes a document describing a general protocol for
doing this. It can be accessed from R using the `access_sheet` function from
`BioCroField` as follows:

```{r access_protocol, eval = FALSE}
access_sheet('weighing_tissue')
```

The details of weighing are somewhat different for each particular crop. The
sheets discussed in the [Crop-Specific Guide Sheets] section include advice and
instructions for weighing tissue from several key crops.

When using these sheets, it is recommended to print out one copy of the weighing
protocol and one copy of each relevant crop guide so you can keep them on hand
for reference while weighing.

# Processing Data with BioCroField

## Digitizing Data

The `harvest_point` function from `BioCroField` has been designed to digitize
the data from one of these crop harvest record sheets. The names of the input
arguments to this function generally match the fields present on the crop
harvest record sheets, making it simple and straighforward to transfer values
from the sheet to a computer. For example, a completed crop harvest record sheet
might look like the following image:

```{r sheet, out.width = '50%', echo = FALSE}
#| fig.cap = "Example of a completed crop harvest record sheet. This represents
#|   information from a single biomass harvest performed on 2022-08-23, where
#|   soybean (var. GM4000) was harvested from plot 3 at UIUC. The row spacing in
#|   the plot was 0.7 m, and there were 150000 plants per acre. A row section 2
#|   m long was harvested for above-ground biomass; this section included 47
#|   plants, and its total dry weight was 1100 g. Six plants were used for
#|   partitioning; their total leaf area was 9000 cm^2, their dry leaf mass was
#|   35 g, their dry stem mass was 55 g, their dry root mass was 15 g, and their
#|   dry pod mass was 30 g. The leaf, stem, and pod components of these plants
#|   form their total above-ground biomass. Finally, a litter trap in the plot
#|   with area 0.2 m^2 was found to contain 3.2 g of leaf litter and 1.5 g of
#|   stem litter. The plant material was dried for 14 days before it was
#|   weighed. _Note_: This is not real data, and GM4000 is not a real soybean
#|   variety, although the values here are reasonable for a typical commercial
#|   soybean cultivar."

knitr::include_graphics('images/example_harvest_sheet.jpg')
```
In this case, the following command can be used to store the information from
the sheet as an R data structure:

```{r}
hp <- harvest_point(
  crop = 'soybean',
  variety = 'GM4000',
  location = 'UIUC',
  plot = 3,
  year = 2022,
  doy = 235,
  planting_density = 150000,
  row_spacing = 0.7,
  partitioning_leaf_area = 9000,
  partitioning_component_weights = list(leaf = 35, stem = 55, root = 15, pod = 30),
  agb_components = c('leaf', 'stem', 'pod'),
  agb_row_length = 2,
  agb_weight = 1100,
  trap_area = 0.2,
  trap_component_weights = list(leaf_litter = 3.2, stem_litter = 1.5),
  partitioning_nplants = 6,
  agb_nplants = 47
)
```

The output from this function is a `harvest_point` object that represents all
the information from the sheet. From a technical point of view, a
`harvest_point` object is just an R list with a particular set of named
elements. The information stored in it can be viewed with standard R commands
like `print` or `str`. For example:

```{r}
str(hp)
```

More information is available via the built-in help system by typing
`?harvest_point` in the R terminal.

## Processing and Organizing Data

Once the data from one or more harvest record sheets has been stored as an
equal number of `harvest_point` objects, it is possible to convert the raw
weights, lengths, and areas into more convenient values like biomass per unit
area and leaf area index. This can be done automatically using the `process`
function from `BioCroField`, which processes a single `harvest_point` object to
convert its information into a more useful form. The following command
illustrates how to process the `harvest_point` defined above and view the
processed values:

```{r}
hpp <- process(hp)

str(hpp)
```

The output from `process` is a `harvest_point` object that has additional named
elements that represent the newly calculated values. More information is
available via the built-in help system by typing `?process` in the R terminal.

Once the data from one or more harvest record sheets has been processed, it can
be reorganized into a `data.frame`, which is often a convenient way to store and
use the data. This can be done using the `biomass_table` function from
`BioCroField`, which accepts one or more `harvest_point` objects, extracts the
most important information from each one, and stores the information in one row
of a `data.frame`. Continuing the example above, we can create a table with one
row from the single `harvest_point`:

```{r}
biomass <- biomass_table(hpp)

str(biomass)
```

With the data in this format, it can also be easily saved in a file using the
`write.csv` function from base R. More information is available via the built-in
help system by typing `?biomass_table` in the R terminal.

## Including Seed Mass

It is often useful to include information about the seeds that were originally
sown, such as the sowing date and the initial biomass per unit area in the
field, even though this is not truly "harvest" information. These details can be
included in a biomass data table (as created by `biomass_table`) using the
`add_seed_biomass` function from `BioCroField`. This operation is included in
the [Full Example][A Full Example] below. More information is available via the
built-in help system by typing `?add_seed_biomass` in the R terminal.

# A Full Example

In this section, we will provide an example where biomass data from three
separate harvests are combined into a table along with information about the
initial seed mass. _Note_: This is not real data, and GM4000 is not a real
soybean variety, although the values here are reasonable for a typical
commercial soybean cultivar.

```{r}
# Specify some pieces of information that are the same for all harvests
crop <- 'soybean'
variety <- 'GM4000'
location <- 'UIUC'
year <- 2022
agb_row_length <- 2
planting_density <- 150000
row_spacing <- 0.7
trap_area <- 0.2
partitioning_nplants <- 6

# Store the measured data values as a list of harvest_point objects
biomass_measurements <- list(
  harvest_point(
    crop = crop,
    variety = variety,
    location = location,
    plot = 2,
    year = year,
    doy = 185,
    planting_density = planting_density,
    row_spacing = row_spacing,
    partitioning_leaf_area = 500,
    partitioning_component_weights = list(leaf = 2.5, stem = 1.5, root = 1.4),
    agb_components = c('leaf', 'stem'),
    agb_row_length = agb_row_length,
    agb_weight = 50,
    trap_area = trap_area,
    trap_component_weights = list(),
    partitioning_nplants = partitioning_nplants,
    agb_nplants = 46
  ),
  harvest_point(
    crop = crop,
    variety = variety,
    location = location,
    plot = 3,
    year = year,
    doy = 235,
    planting_density = planting_density,
    row_spacing = row_spacing,
    partitioning_leaf_area = 9000,
    partitioning_component_weights = list(leaf = 35, stem = 55, root = 15, pod = 30),
    agb_components = c('leaf', 'stem', 'pod'),
    agb_row_length = agb_row_length,
    agb_weight = 1100,
    trap_area = trap_area,
    trap_component_weights = list(leaf_litter = 3.2, stem_litter = 1.5),
    partitioning_nplants = partitioning_nplants,
    agb_nplants = 47
  ),
  harvest_point(
    crop = crop,
    variety = variety,
    location = location,
    plot = 1,
    year = year,
    doy = 275,
    planting_density = planting_density,
    row_spacing = row_spacing,
    partitioning_leaf_area = 0,
    partitioning_component_weights = list(leaf = 0, stem = 40, root = 13, pod = 175, seed = 130),
    agb_components = c('leaf', 'stem', 'pod'),
    agb_row_length = agb_row_length,
    agb_weight = 1000,
    trap_area = trap_area,
    trap_component_weights = list(leaf_litter = 45, stem_litter = 15),
    partitioning_nplants = partitioning_nplants,
    agb_nplants = 51
  )
)

# Convert measured values into masses per area in BioCro units
processed_biomass_measurements <- lapply(biomass_measurements, process)

# Specify mass values that should be set to zero when not explicitly measured
zero_when_missing <- c('pod', 'leaf_litter', 'stem_litter')

# Reorganize values into a data frame
soybean_biomass <- do.call(
  biomass_table,
  c(processed_biomass_measurements, list(zero_when_missing = zero_when_missing))
)

# Add the initial values to the data frame
soybean_biomass <- add_seed_biomass(
  soybean_biomass,
  year = year,
  doy = 152,
  seed_mass = 0.17,
  zero_when_missing = zero_when_missing,
  component_fractions = list(leaf = 0.8, stem = 0.1, root = 0.1)
)
```

Now we can take a look at the final data values:
```{r}
str(soybean_biomass)
```

It is also easy to graph them:
```{r}
xyplot(
  leaf + stem + root + pod + leaf_litter + stem_litter ~ doy,
  data = soybean_biomass,
  type = 'b',
  pch = 16,
  auto = TRUE,
  grid = TRUE,
  xlab = 'Day of year (2022)',
  ylab = 'Biomass (Mg / ha)'
)
```

Optionally, the final biomass table can be saved as a CSV file or as an R data
file; one or both of these commands could be included in a processing script:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Save the data as an R data file
save(soybean_biomass, file = 'soybean_biomass.RData')

# Save the data as a CSV file
write.csv(soybean_biomass, file = 'soybean_biomass.csv', row.names = FALSE)
```
