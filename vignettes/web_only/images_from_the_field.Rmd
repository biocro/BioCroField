# Overview

This vignette shows some helpful example images that were taken while harvesting
and weighing tissue. This vignette is a work in progress, and more images will
be added in the future.

# Harvesting Plant Tissue

## Soybean Walkthrough

This section illustrates the key harvest steps using soybean as an example.

1. Measure out two meters from one of the inner rows and cut the stems just
above the ground. If a litter trap is not present, also collect any litter on
the ground that can clearly be associated with the plants that were cut.

```{r abg_cutting, out.width = '50%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('field_images/agb_cutting.jpg')
```

2. Count and collect the plants, and then fold them and put them in a large lawn
bag. When the plants are dense, it can be helpful to cut them in groups of ten
and count them at the end.

```{r abg_collecting, out.width = '50%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('field_images/agb_collecting.jpg')
```

3. Record key information on the bag itself, including the number of plants and
the length of the row section. This can be transferred to the harvest record
sheet later.

```{r abg_bag, out.width = '50%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('field_images/agb_bag.jpg')
```

## Harvesting Maize Ears

Large fertilized ears can be simply snapped off the stem. Unfertilized ears are
also harvested. They can be difficult to find if they have not emerged or
produced silks, but they can nevertheless be cut out of the stems. The image
below shows some unfertilized maize ears during a harvest.

```{r maize_ears_unfertilized, out.width = '50%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('field_images/maize_ears_unfertilized.jpg')
```

# Weighing Tissue

## Weighing Maize Ears

The kernels can be removed by hand from the husked cob.

```{r maize_cob_kernels, out.width = '50%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('field_images/maize_cob_kernels.jpg')
```

## Weighing Sorghum Panicles

After weighing the intact sorghum panicles and threshing off the grain, the next
step is to remove and weigh the flowers. The image below shows the flowers while
they are being weighed.

```{r sorghum_flowers, out.width = '50%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('field_images/sorghum_flowers.jpg')
```

The image below shows the remnants of the sorghum panicles after the grain and
flowers have been removed. These are essentially just segments of the stem.

```{r sorghum_panicle_stems, out.width = '50%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('field_images/sorghum_panicle_stems.jpg')
```

# Miscellaneous Field Considerations

## Protecting Sorghum Panicles

Flocks of starlings may eat the sorghum grain. To protect it, cover the panicles
with large "fruit protection bags." These are mesh bags that allow air flow but
prevent bird damage. They are time-consuming to attach, so they should only be
placed on panicles in the middle two rows. The image below shows a damaged
panicle in the foreground, while the panicles in bags are still in perfect
shape.

```{r sorghum_panicle_damage, out.width = '50%', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('field_images/sorghum_panicle_damage.jpg')
```
