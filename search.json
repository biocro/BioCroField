R function accepts information crop harvest record sheet stores convenient data structure. Additional R functions calculate key variables raw measurements reorganize results convenient format. Together, features provide straightforward system obtaining data creating full record analysis. collecting measuring plant material, complete description data can created follows: Store images completed crop harvest record sheets directory. Store commands used digitize process data (ones Full Example section document) R script directory. Save final biomass data table plain-text file directory using write.csv.

Nevertheless, yield proven useful concept, least partially intrinsic property depend size field crops grown. interesting note harvested material per plant far less useful. crops grown higher densities, competition plants increases, plant tends produce less output. Thus, harvest per plant depends crop’s inhererent productivity also degree competition plants. hand, often fairly wide range plant population (number plants per unit area) can result identical similar yield; example, maize Illinois sown April 5 May 5 can reach 97% higher maximum yield populations 24,000 36,000 plants per acre Nafziger (1994). Thus, circumstances, yield (per area basis) better reflects true productivity crop without complicating influence competition. context crop growth modeling, typically interested predicting yield (mass per unit area) particular crop variety particular location. , however, generally necessary predict amount plant components (masses per unit area), following: Leaf: amount leaf mass determines amount carbon crop able assimilate process photosynthesis, leaf mass critical calculating growth rates.
