Additional R functions calculate key variables raw measurements reorganize results convenient format. Together, features provide straightforward system obtaining data creating full record analysis. collecting measuring plant material, complete description data can created follows: Store images completed crop harvest record sheets directory.

Nevertheless, yield proven useful concept, least partially intrinsic property depend size field crops grown. interesting note harvested material per plant far less useful. crops grown higher densities, competition plants increases, plant tends produce less output. Thus, harvest per plant depends crop’s inhererent productivity also degree competition plants. hand, often fairly wide range plant population (number plants per unit area) can result identical similar yield; example, maize Illinois sown April 5 May 5 can reach 97% higher maximum yield populations 24,000 36,000 plants per acre (Nafziger 1994). Thus, circumstances, yield (per area basis) better reflects true productivity crop without complicating influence competition. context crop growth modeling, typically interested predicting yield (mass per unit area) particular crop variety particular location. , however, generally necessary predict amount plant components (masses per unit area), following: Leaf: amount leaf mass determines amount carbon crop able assimilate process photosynthesis, leaf mass critical calculating growth rates. Root: amount root mass determines amount water nitrogen crop able obtain soil. Litter: crop ages, begins lose tissue process senescence. lost mass recycled parts plant, remainder shed, forming litter. competing processes growth senescence determine masses components like leaf root. Total: Besides components mentioned , crop also uses carbon grow stem reproductive material like flowers pods. accurate predictions, essential accurately model distribution carbon throughout crop components. Therefore, validate crop model, important experimental measurements crop components, ideally multiple times throughout growing season. addition masses, critical measure leaf area index (LAI), defined leaf area per unit ground area, also plays key role simulating photosynthesis canopy level (Bréda 2003). model able reproduce mass leaf area measurements, can faith able make accurate yield predictions situations.","code":""},{"path":"https://biocro.github.io/BioCroField/articles/handling_biomass_measurements.html","id":"harvesting-material","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Harvesting Material","title":"Handling Biomass Measurements","text":"make measurements important quantities, necessary sow multiple plots harvest plants single randomly-chosen plot several times throughout growing season, ending final harvest. plot also contain wire mesh litter trap known area, harvest generally include following steps: Choose section row known length; count plants contained row section; cut stem just ground; collect -ground portions plant bag dried weighed. can provide estimates population, -ground biomass (AGB) per unit area, AGB per plant. measurement, length row containing approximately 1-4 dozen plants (depending size spacing) used.

Be careful, and try to avoid damaging the roots #>   themselves, because any small pieces that fall off might be difficult to #>   recover and weigh. #>  #> - **Plant Litter**: The plant litter should be sorted into components as #>   necessary, discarding any soil or foreign material. Each component should be #>   separately weighed and recorded in the \"partitioned plant components\" section #>   of the harvest log sheet. The name of these components should clearly indicate #>   they represent litter; for example, **Leaf Litter**. #>  #> - **Litter Trap**: The litter trap contents should be sorted into components as necessary, #> discarding any soil or foreign material.
